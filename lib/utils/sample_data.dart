    ingredients: 'Plantain , vegtable oil, salt',
    prepare: "Fried plantain is a popular West African delicacy made by slicing ripe plantains and frying them until golden brown. The plantains, naturally sweet and soft when ripe, develop a caramelized, crispy exterior while staying tender inside. First, the plantains are peeled and cut into round or diagonal slices. They're then lightly salted and placed into hot oil, where they sizzle and cook until they reach a rich golden color. Once done, they're removed and drained of excess oil. Fried plantain is sweet, slightly crispy, and pairs perfectly with rice, beans, eggs, or can be enjoyed alone as a tasty snack.",
